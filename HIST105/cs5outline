Introduction
- Definition of colonialism.
- Some background on British and French colonies.
- Briefly state the reasons for decolonization.
  - Popular opinion shifting against colonization because empires were seen as hyprocrites.
  - The demonstration effect.


Body Paragraph 1 - Leading reasons for political decolonization.
- Talk about how the empires justified cononialism.
  - The empire would say the the colony was stateless. Using this justification colonizers would invade stating that they would "civilize" the people of the colony. This is referred to as the Terra Nullis justification (Reading 1, 5). 
  - Using the terra nullis justification the colonizers would economically exploit the colony by paying extremely low wages (Reading 1, 7).
  - Transition this into how colonizers were hypocrites (Primary Source 2, 2).
- Popular opinion of the colonizers in Europe was declining. It was seen as hypocritical that they would preach freedom for me but not for thee sorta thing (Reading 2, 5). A great example of this is the French, where the revolution was based on equality, but they were also profific colonizers.
- Demonstration effect. Seeing other colonies break away from the empires rule would galvanize the colonies people to fight for liberty and self-governence. An example of this is Ghana gaining independence caused much of west Africa to fight for their independence (Reading 2, 7). Another great exampl
- Could add another section about the soviet union and the united states being against colonization due to business interests.


Body Paragraph 2 - Examples of ways that political decolonization did and did not end colonialism.
- There are two perspectives on how to end political decolonization. One is through the perspective of a historical event, where decolonization is the colonizers leaving the colonized to self governance (Reading 4, 1). There are many examples of successful decolonization under this definition. 
  - An example of a way that political decolonization did end is in Algeria. The National Liberation Front of Algeria was the liberation of French colonization. Eventually the French withdrew and Algeria was able to be self governed (Primary Source 5, 2).
- The other perspective on decolonization is the idea that decolonization is about removing the legacy of colonization (Reading 4, 1).
  - This is a much more difficult goal to achieve and is not simply done with political decolonization. 
  - An example of this is how formerly colonized countries in Africa still speak in the colonizers language, where the legacy of colonization lives on (Seondary Source Archive, 5).


Body Paragraph 3 - Suggestions for students or faculty to reform the cirriculum.
- An example where decolonization the cirriculum could work very well is in a history class. Teaching students about perspectives beyond that of white europeans. A way that this could be done by studying a geologically diverse perspective of stories and figures.
  - I think decolonizing the cirriculum in this way could be very valuable for students. Learning about perspectives from countries in Africa, Asia, and South America, or even the middle east could really broaden a students worldy knowledge beyond that of their own country.
- I do think decolonizing the cirriculum is a good idea, as long as its not taken too far. My definition of too far would be putting up barriers to the learning experience. One of these barriers could be a language change to a native language that isn't widely spoken. While this would be removing the legacy of colonization, the barriers to the learning experience would be too great because students would need to learn another languange.
