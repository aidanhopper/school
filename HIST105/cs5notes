- Used indirect rule, which employed a small number of europeans to govern a larger body of colonized peoples (6).
- Indirect rule used a divide-and-conquer strategy which divided the colony into groups based on race. The colonized people were at the bottom and Europeans were at the top, with migrants not from Europe were in the middle (7).
- Colonizing was justified by Europeans by claiming they were "civilizing" the colony (8).
- Indirect rule was used because it was economically efficient for the empire to exploit the colony. Workers were paid little, and the companies in empire had a monopoly in the colony. Becasue of all this investors would get a high rate of return in the colony (9 & 10).

- Because of ww2 empires were drained of european man power and economic resources so indirect rule became much more difficult, and people of color were being relied on to fight in colonies and europe because of this. Colonial explointation also grew (2 & 3).
- The cold war also contributed to decolonization, the two new superpowers the soviet union and the united states were anti-colonial, and they supported anti-colonial movements (4).
- anti-colonial activists exposed the idea that colonizers expressed values of equality but did not practice those values dealing with the colonies. These contradictions were exposed to a large population of Europeans through the radio and television and popular opinion turned against the empires (5).
- European colonies became more tied to eachother and less to the colonies because of the rome treaty in 1957 (5) [ You can see how this is the perfect storm for decolonization to occur because public opinion was turning against it and empires were becoming less and less economically reliant on colonies ].
